# Parton Shower Simulator

## Introduction

The purpose of this code is to perform a simple parton shower based on analytical calculations of the sudakov factors, which includes g->gg and g->qqbar splittings. The code allows to change the expression used for the splitting functions. The code is contained in the the Mathematica package [PartonShowerMCFull.wl](https://github.com/ginnocen/PartonShowerHIPackage/blob/main/Package/PartonShowerMCFull.wl), 
which contains both the implementation and the plotting utilities. 

The code is based on a software package developed by Gavin Salam [zuoz2016-toy-shower](https://github.com/gavinsalam/zuoz2016-toy-shower), which was used for his lectures at the "PSI Summer School Exothiggs", Zuoz, August 2016 (https://www.psi.ch/particle-zuoz-school/ltp-zuoz-summer-school).
